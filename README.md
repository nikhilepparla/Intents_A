1)Explicit intents are intents where you exactly know which activity you are going to deliver
 Main usage of Explicit intents are 
  -> Start Activity
  -> Start Service
  -> Deliver a Broadcast
   
2)Implicit intent 
 This will not specify exact Activity you want to Direct to
 It will give Android Os the choice to open the Activity which is compatible to the intent requested
